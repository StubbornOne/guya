  "description": "Tea for Universe, Tea for Life.  It's the Sengoku Era, a time when warring daimyou usurped each other constantly. There was a man whose soul was overtaken by the ways of tea and material greed as he worked his way up toward greater power and status. His name was Furuta Sasuke, a vassal of Oda Nobunaga. With his world broadened by the genius Nobunaga and with the spiritual insight learned from Senno Soueki, Master of Tea, Sasuke travels the road of the Hyouge Mono, or comical fellow.\nTo live or not to live. For power or for the arts. That is the question",
